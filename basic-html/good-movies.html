    This page is practice of using HTML tables. 
    Here's some movies that I like:
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Movie Title</th>
                <th>Brenn's Reason for liking</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Tropic Thunder</td>
                <td>The movie is fantastically funny, and quite ridiculous. The self-mockery of the entertainment industry is insightful. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</td>
                <td>This movie is a classic! There are many fun references. </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
